### What is this about

This is a test given to me for the position of principle frontend engineer, The task is to call a mock api and render a list of users. There should be a create and edit forms as well which will do a service call but will not update the API (for obvious reasons).

### Technologies used

- Next js as the underling framework
- TypeScripts for type safely and maintainability
- Tailwind css for styling
- Redux for state management
- Formik for forms along with yup for schema creation
- Eslint for coding standard
- Pretter to keep the code styling
- Husky to make sure we only push quality code to the git hub

### How to run

- pull the code from the repo
- `npm install` - to install the relevant dependencies
- `npm run dev` will start the dev server

### Demo

### Special notes and Apologies

- Apologies for the project is not 100% (the dashboard is yet to complete) as its hard to finish everything with other commitments
- Didn't had a chance to spend time on figma to design something beautiful
- Architecture, code quality and coding standards are in the hight of standards but didn't have a UI to follow.
